Wander the weary, though formless his goal\
Upon the weathered bones of some lost soul\
Pale arm outstretched, right at the breach\
The maw of a cave, salvation just out of reach\
\
Its shackles fallen to rot's division\
Freedom in death, yet forever imprisoned\
Lines of rust traced back like veins\
To chasmic depths which forged its chains\
\
From the chasm below, a honeyed voice sings\
"Oh weary traveler, come down, live out your dreams."\
His heart did leap, he spun with a gasp\
To stand over the corpse, at once entranced\
\
"Yet how can that be? I know not what I seek"\
He called to this mysterious patron of the deep\
His shadow played with the burning sun\
Across cavern walls, first steps already begun\
\
"Be not afraid and ye shall find\
All the knowledge held captive by the divine"\
At this, with abandon, he plunged within\
Forgetting all thought of the corpse that had been.\
\
Though soon all light was lost to the press\
And the weary traveler choked with distress\
He began to doubt this journey's worth\
A forlorn quest beneath the earth?\
\
As one step faltered, and the next postponed\
The voice, it cried, "you're not alone"\
Its sonorous echoes lured him on\
Soon joined by others in virtuous song\
\
This harmony of sorts held off the gloom\
A legion of sirens leading him off to his tomb\
With each new promise his steps grew quicker\
Till at last a corner, and firelight's flicker\
\
A dozen skeletons dancing in the flames\
Circling about as they rattled their chains\
On high, a pedestal, a small black mirror\
To him it sang "Just come a bit nearer"\
\
Around the ring, he took his place\
And sold his soul without thought for grace\
Out from darkness came a delighted squeal\
Emerging from shadows, a legion revealed\
\
From the dark siren, a final sound:\
"To swine of Gedara, we are no longer bound"
