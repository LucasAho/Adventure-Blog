Oh dearest Diana, your pale moonlight\
Filters through leaves from your place on high\
To awake the machine, its rusted gears excite\
Towards you it climbs, though it knows not why\
\
Charging forth, ancient joints creak and sigh\
No closer you grow, yet there is further to rise\
Through forest and field, where a mountain scrapes the sky\
As surely you wane, the harder it drives\
\
In a frenzy of sparks, it chases your prize\
Tearing forth though inner gears grind\
Ever you dim, shining half your size\
Its sprockets fly loose - a trail of rust behind\
\
Lost in the hills, this little machine dwined\
A steady disintegration it cannot sustain\
Yet of your sweet moonlight, a sliver remind:\
How high it has risen above the plain\
\
Clambering forth, its final fumes drain\
As it mounts a summit submerged in night\
This errand an error, there is not to attain\
Yet peaceful, it sleeps 'neath soft starlight
