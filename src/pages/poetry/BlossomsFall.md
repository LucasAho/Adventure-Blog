How savage the bite of that wicked winter wind\
Whistling through bare branches and chiseling my skin\
A new day's dawn brings more of the same\
Yet I'd wait here an eternity to see green again\
\
Then one morning quite like the last\
I notice a finger, a single blade of grass\
Burgeoning through soil still yellow and cold\
So there I kneel and give the warmth in my soul\
\
Little did I know, it was not needed\
A verdant plain grew as winter depleted\
Even that barest of trees joined the show\
Ready to blossom under Spring's soft glow\
\
Beneath that tree, I whooped and wept\
For in the winter, when I should have slept\
I'd laid in its roots, counting the stars\
Saying, "be still my heart, for Spring shall be ours"\
\
And ours it was, as the world sprouted to life\
White blossoms that shone on the darkest of nights\
The birds came to sing from their nest in the tree\
And for a moment, I thought, "forever this shall be"\
\
But all too soon, the sky grew black\
Furious with storms, and thunder cracked\
Too short was I to shield my tree\
Helpless to watch as blossoms covered my feet\
\
Though the storm did pass, only a few could cling\
Those beautiful blossoms that boasted of Spring\
On a quiet night, a soft rain came\
And they too fell as crickets sang\
\
In the wind they drifted away\
No matter how madly I begged them to stay\
And though I feasted on fruit that remained\
Sheltered under green from the heat of the day\
\
Summer itself must come to pass\
It's the changing of the seasons, for nothing can last\
But as the leaves fall and trees grow bare\
I hold onto hope that Spring comes once more
