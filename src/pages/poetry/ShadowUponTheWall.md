Dance with the shadow upon the wall\
Decay by the decade, resisting its call\
Howl of the void: dissolution of all\
\
This fork in the road, the familiar weight\
Of a choice lade on strings of fate\
Doubt takes hold, familiar embrace\
Echo on stone tiles, I pace\
\
A siren's song to silent abyss\
How it brims with black oil, dribble, and spit\
So rotten a place, for all my preacher's wit\
\
O' Forgotten vagrant of aberrant halls\
The grudging gnomon on labyrinth walls\
A maze so bleached in consuming flame\
I'm devoured of all but shame\
\
After a lifetime chasing the rapture\
Grains of Edith are all I scatter\
With no sign yet of foul hope's greener pasture\
\
For far too long, I've sought that end\
An escape from the maze by a savior's hand\
This shadow now cast, Messiah arrives?\
Peace for a pariah in the Creator's eyes?\
\
So though this apodictic shadow gives stay\
Its vapid howls evoking dismay\
It is my bassal instincts I must betray\
\
To erase my fear of nothing\
To erase my fear of self\
Embrace finality, her long awaited kiss\
The endless echo of eternal bliss\
\
Step by step, the looming cure\
One foot in, filled with fear\
Darkness yields to a cracked black mirror\
\
The hollow reflection of a faltering ghost\
The grim reminder of my crumbling host\
Rending flame doth lash its spine\
A farewell's kick, this was by design
