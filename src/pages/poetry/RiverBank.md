Along a shore of acid washed pebbles,\
I gaze across Styx's boiling waters.\
Desire to meet those awaiting devils.\
Covet those ranked as myth faded martyrs.\
\
Beg passage from Charon, let me barter\
I've lint, crumpled notes, a white flick for fire?\
Refused, obol alone affords charter,\
And no path leads from this Stygian mire\
\
Rage fallen to anguish, hate to desire\
The banks with acid splashes, lull me close\ 
Acid of Styx, such ease could I respire\
A mere breath before she took me, I froze.\
\ 
I remain, walk this shore of bleached white stone.\
Remain to cultivate these seeds I've sown.
