A grasshopper fell in my window well\
Its camo neon green\
So well it'd blend in fields of grass\
So stark against these broken human things\
\
Was this the world its mother knew\
When she passed down colors no longer seen\
In this world of concrete and empty metal things?\
\
Its legs tense up, springs bound tight\
And it rockets towards the sky\
That narrow slit of blue that hints at daylight\
\
Yet the walls are slick and the channel deep\
It falls back to the stone\
Laid by humans with no thought of a world outside their own\
\
Again it cranks its legs up tight\
But the end is set in stone\
It falls back down to the world that can never be its own\
\
And so I watch and wonder if\
I ought to grant it grace\
Then I think to the neighbor's well\
And the thousands in its place\
\
And so I sit and wonder if\
I am not the same\
As the men who dug this pit\
To make this world their claim
