Aside the stream of a starving king\
The valley beneath that rolling stone\
Icarus weeps on sodden wings\
He knows not how to get home

Eternal penance at Rhamnusia's hand\
He bloodies his fingers to no fruition\
To balance the scales by grains of sand\
Though leaden the hubris of his perdition
 
Beneath a blue moon, the fulcrum bends\
His chest does swell as freedom nears\
Lesson unlearned, his progress ends\
Spew protest and prayer upon deaf ears
 
He curses the father who gave him flight\
Condemns Apollo's avaricious pride\
Petty the god who bears no slight                                                 
Through no fault of his own had Icarus died

Yet with none to hear, he burned within\
The youth of his soul to ember and ash\
Now but cinders, the fire wears thin\
Hollow and wretched, his teeth do gnash

While this obdurate oaf claws at his past\
Pitifully plucking what feathers remain\
Such does the weight of his sin amass\
That he sinks to his knees, not stacking a grain

Succumbed to fate, his pride plateaus\
And though the extent of which enough to whelm\
He lifts himself from his repose\
And sets to wander in Tartar's realm
