I know not when I awoke on this long and winding road\
With these burning cheeks and this ache deep within my throat\
The rutted tracks of my forebears meandered long ahead\
With no end in sight and the pace unset, I began with just a step
 
For a time I begged of the brush and branch that scratched upon my flesh:\
For what purpose do I walk, when I could just sit here instead\
The wind howled back an answer that I could not detect\
And so I walked along the path, the road that never ends
 
Once I learned to stop and smell the blossoms at my feet\
I realized that that this road I took was nothing but conceit\
So I lost my way and found myself in the highest mountain pass\
High above where the air grew thin, and I thought I'd breathe my last
 
And so I made my back down - to the safety of the path\
For good or ill, I knew it then: this life is all I have\
From then on I wandered still, but always kept in sight\
The road that lead on and on, to an end I'll never know
 
Then one day, in my peace, I was shocked to see\
Far ahead, in a field of wheat, a crossroad broke the scene\
And from the other path there came an echo of my dreams\
The face of one not mistook, a figure from my destiny
 
Though I knew not how to speak, my hand she took from me\
And along the road we walked, to see where it would lead
